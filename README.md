# Grid-Resource-Optimizer

website link: https://lnkd.in/gZCk7rb2

This project is a web-based application designed to simulate checkpointing in grid computing systems and demonstrate various multi-objective optimization techniques. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it compatible with mobile environments like Termux on your Moto G45 device.

Key Components

1. Fault Tolerance and Distributed Systems:

Simulates basic fault-tolerant mechanisms and distributed commit protocols.

Demonstrates how grid systems recover using checkpointing strategies.



2. Checkpointing Simulation:

Implements both system-level and application-level checkpointing.

Simulates different checkpointing storage strategies.

Allows users to visualize checkpoint-based rollback recovery.

4. Interactive Grid Simulation:

A dynamic canvas-based simulation to visualize grid nodes, checkpointing, and fault recovery.

Users can customize parameters (e.g., grid size, fault probability) to see real-time results.
